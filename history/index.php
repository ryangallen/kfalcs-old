			<h1>History Of The Kamikaze Falcons</h1>
			<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
			<p>
				One night in early March 2012 after an intramural volleyball game, Jeremy Drager and Matt Durham hung out at Chad Paulinski's apartment in Ann Arbor. 
				When the three discussed work and future job prospects, attention turned towards a hockey stick Chad was using to play street hockey with co-workers from his office.
				As conversation went towards the Red Wings and the NHL, the idea of playing in an ice hockey league was formed. Although this idea was initially shrugged off, all three were enthusiastic
				about playing ice hockey with friends. Ice arena locations and potential players were sought out in hopes of forming a team before spring hockey leagues started in April.
			</p>
			<p>
				By March 26th, an early roster was formed with commits Isaac Clark, Sam and Charles Machi, Ryan Allen, "Evil" Jeremy Coan as the team's goaltender, Ryan Sergison, and Chris Dixon.
				As time was slowly closing on April spring league availability, Jeremy Coan suggested playing at Royal Oak's John Lindell Ice Arena, whose spring league started in May. Since the team was 
				worried about not having enough players, merging with another team in the league was considered but quickly abandonded. A Google document was created by Jeremy Drager to survey the current 
				team with ideas for a team name, colors, and captaincy. On April 15th, the results of the Gooel doc survey were finalized: Jeremy Coan's team name suggestion of 'The Kamikaze Falcons' won 
				over names 'The Dinosaurs' and 'The Stags', Isaac's color suggestion of Burnt Orange/White won over colors Red/White, Maize/Blue and Purple/White, and Isaac was voted Captain while both 
				Jeremys were voted as Alternates. With registration to the John Lindell Ice Arena D League, the Kamikaze Falcons were officially born.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of April, the roster expanded to include Alex Hock, Andy Ballard, Tom Phillips, Nick Cicchetti, and George Morris. On the week of May 6th, the Kamikaze Falcons' schedule filled up
				with a practice on Monday and the team's first game on Thursday. The first season had begun.
			</p>
			<h2>Season One</h2>
			<p>
				The league consisted of four teams: The Kamikaze Falcons, the D Rangers, The Honey Badgers, and Team 4 - The Loozers. The first game of the season for the Falcons was against the D Rangers on May 10th.
				Unbeknownst to the Kamikaze Falcons, the D Rangers were actually a C league team, and it showed after the Rangers destroyed the Falcons 9-2. The Rangers, with their captain Rick Nash, 
				would eventually go undefeated in the league. The Kamikaze Falcons' first win came one game later against The Loozers, winning 9-5, and would go 2-2 against them in the regular season. 
				The classy Honey Badgers would end up defeating the Kamikaze Falcons twice out of three games in the regular season, however in the second-to-last game of the regular season the Falcons defeated
				the Honey Badgers 9-2, tying both the season-high goals for in a game and the season-low goals against in a game. Propelled by the high caliber play of the Euro Twins Nick Cicchetti and George Morris, 
				the rock-solid defense of Ryan Sergison, the tenacious hard work of Tom Phillips, and the stellar goaltending of Jeremy Coan, the Kamikaze Falcons posted a regular season record of 3-7.
				The Kamikaze Falcons only got better with time, winning two of the last three games and launched themselves into the coveted third seed. Unfortunately, the season came to an end in the first
				round of playoffs, losing to the Honey Badgers 5-3 on August 2nd.
			</p>
			<h2>Reformation and Season Two</h2>
			<p>
				The Fall/Winter season started only a month later, and with many teammates leaving to go on to bigger things, the remaining Kamikaze Falcons were left scrambling. Matt Durham, Andy Ballard 
				and Chris Dixon could not participate in Season Two. Isaac Clark, Shawn Hardy, Alex Hock, Brandt Williams, Nick Cicchetti and George Morris played in at least one game each but couldn't 
				partake in a full season. By the start of the season - September 10th - the team added John Floreno, David Cipparone, Zachary Klug, and Adam Dearing, and Ryan Allen created kamikazefalcons.com.
				Before the fifth game on October 8th, Bob Sarosy and Mike Abisch joined the team, and two days later Paul Rotarius joined the team. Alex Machi was added to the roster on October 14th. On 
				November 26th, the final Fall 12/Winter 13 roster addition was made when Shane Madaus joined the team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Season Two featured eight teams in the D League: The Kamikaze Falcons, The Honey Badgers, Victorious Secret, The Jets, The RTT Crashers, The Wolfpack, The Wolves,
				and the Grand Trunk Pub. The Kamikaze Falcons lost the first four games by a combined score total of 18-2, and would continue to lose big. The Falcons would post a season-high Goals Against loss
				against the Jets 0-12 on October 29th. The first win of the season for the Kamikaze Falcons came against the RTT Crashers with a score of 5-2 on November 26th. Heading into the Holiday Break, the
				Falcons were just 1-14 with 13 Goals For and 96 Goals Against.
			</p>
			<p>
				After the Holiday Break, the Kamikaze Falcons could not shake off the Christmas cookie rust as they looked sluggish in a 2-9 loss on January 7th to Victorious Secret. However the Falcons roared back,
				playing the league-leading Wolves close in a 4-6 loss and winning the second game of the season a week later against the Wolfpack 3-2.
			</p>
			<h3>Editor's note</h3>
			<p>
				At the time of writing this (January 29th), the season is still ongoing, so the rest, they say, is history (Or history will be made). The Kamikaze Falcons have and will always enjoy a
				committment to excellence, dedication to the team, and love for the game. The Falcons' rich history is evident not only on the ice, but off the ice as well, with strong friendships formed inside
				the team and also with the team's supporters. The team's supporters, dubbed 'The Falcon's Nest', are loyal, loud, and enthusiastic game in and game out. Being a part of the Kamikaze Falcons
				is truly an amazing and fulfilling experience.
